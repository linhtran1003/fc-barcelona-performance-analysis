# Project Title: Performance Analysis of FC Barcelona - A Decade of Evolution and Recurring Challenges in Competitions

## Project Overview and Motivation

- After their peak in 2014/2015, FC Barcelona has transitioned from European dominance to facing recurring challenges in both domestic and continental competitions. This project analyzes FC Barcelona's performance trends over the past decade (2014–2025) in domestic (La Liga) and international (UEFA Champions League) competitions. It explores attacking and defensive metrics, finishing efficiency, and financial factors such as transfer spending and squad cost limits to identify potential drivers behind the club’s recent decline and rebuilding phase.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Github for version control and project sharing

## Key Analysis and Findings

### Perforamance Trends

- Goals scored at the highest level between 14/15 and 16/17, and then declined gradually, reaching the lowest in 2022.
- League rank doesn't always directly correlate with goals scored, highlighting other influencing factors such as defensive performance and consistency.
