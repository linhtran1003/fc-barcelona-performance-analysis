## Background & Overview

After the historic treble in 2014/15, FC Barcelona faced a decade of highs and lows. On-field performance fluctuated, defensive stability declined, and financial instability forced major structural adjustments. This project investigates the club’s:

- Competitive performance in domestic (La Liga) and international (UEFA Champions League) competitions
- Finishing efficiency and Defensive weaknesses
- Financial constraints, including transfer spending and salary cap limits, and their influence on team outcomes

The analysis aims to uncover how financial and operational decisions correlate with on-field performance, offering insights relevant to business strategy and operational efficiency.

**Research Question**:

`How did FC Barcelona go from European dominance to financial and competitive instability, and what factors explain their decline and recovery?`

## Insight Deep Dive & Visualizations

### 🟣 Insights About FC Barcelona's Performance in Domestic Competition over The Past Decade

![La Liga Performance Trends](./outputs/figures/goals_vs_rank.png)

- Goals scored declined 41% from their peak of 116 (2016/17) to 68 (2021/22).
- Win rate declined from 79% (2014/15) to 55% (2021/22), indicating loss of competitiveness and cosistency.
- Despite fluctuations in goals scored, league rank did not always follow the same pattern, indicating that defensive stability and match consistency played a crucial role in match and league outcomes.

### 🟡 Insights About Their Weakenesses in Defense Based on Scoring Trends

![Defensive Weakness Visualizations](./outputs/figures/goals_vs_goals-against.png)

- The line charts above illustrate goals distribution of FCB over the past 10 years. As shown by 2nd chart, the goal difference (goals scored - goals against) decreased gradually after 2016. This indicates that although the team maintained strong attacking numbers throughout the decade, but goals conceded increased steadily after 2016, reducing goal difference each season.
- Goals conceded increased 81% between 2014/15 (21 GA) and 2021/22 (38 GA). The 2021/22 season shows the most severe imbalance: lowest goals scored (68) + unusually high goals conceded (38), producing the decade’s lowest goal difference.
- Despite scoring fewer goals in 2022/23, this season marked a defensive turnaround as Barcelona improved their ranking due to a 47% reduction in goals conceded, coinciding with managerial and tactical changes - which reflected tactical restructuring and emphasized the importance of compact defense beside pure attacking output.
- However, the subsequent 23/24 season raised questions about their consistency. Despite tactical improvement, the team’s defensive performance deteriorated, with goals conceded reaching their highest level in a decade (44). This suggests that besides manager - other factors such as player dependency or financial situation - may have influenced their on-pitch performance, especially in defense.

### 🔴 Insights About Their Finishing Efficiency Based on Goals-For (GF) and Expected-goals (xG)

![Finishing Efficiency Visualization](./outputs/figures/finishing_eff.png)

- Efficiency is measured as the ratio of Goals-For (GF) to Expected Goals (xG) (`GF/xG`) (based on ball situations), where a ratio above 1 indicates overperformance and below 1 indicates underperformance.
- **Open play:** Involving the play of live ball, usually contributes the majority of goals of any team. From **2014–2019**, Barcelona slightly overperformed in open play with an average of 1.05 GF/xG, indicating high finishing quality from elite forwards. After **2019/20**, there was a decrease of 11% to an average of 0.93 GF/xG, suggesting fewer clinical chances converted despite similar chance volume.
- **Set pieces:** Corner kick and freekick are usually parts of set piece but analyzing them separately will provides better understanding and visualization of their performance trend. FC Barcelona showed strong execution in dead-ball scenarios between 2014 and 2019, especially in freekick with an average of 1.38 GF/xG. However, freekick efficiency declined sharply to 0.8 GF/xG - a drop of 42% - after Messi’s departure (2020), confirming strong dependency on a key player.

### 🔵 Insights About Their International Performance

![UCL Stage Progression and Scoring Trends](./outputs/figures/ucl_stage_progression_and_stats.png)

- Since the 2014/15 UCL title, Barcelona consistently struggled in knock-out rounds of UEFA Champions League, with **7 early exits in the last 10 seasons**.
- Their performance fluctuated post-2018/19 and reached lowest level in 2021/22. They were demoted to the Europa League in 2021/22 and 2022/23 after failing the group stage at UCL, highlighting the club was **unable to compete at high-level competition intensity during its financial crisis.**
- Although goals scored slightly improved the following seasons, defensive collapses in key matches (e.g., away legs) severely limited UCL progression.
- The 2024/25 run again emphasizes a persisten weakness in defense with highest goals scored but also highest goals conceded in 10 years and again eliminated in Semi-Finals.
- While their attacking performance significantly improves and remains relatively strong, defensive vulnerabilities at decisive moments continue to limit their success in international competitions.

#### → Insight Summary

    Overall finishing inefficiency post-2020 especially when combined with defensive issues, may have cost Barcelona decisive points in both domestic and international competitions

### 🟠 Insights About Amount Spending on Transfer Market

![Transfer Spending](./outputs/figures/transfer_expenditures.png)

- From 2014 to 2020, the club maintained a stable financial status, reflected in consistently high levels of transfer spending and the freedom to pursue marquee signings. Over €1.1B spent from 2016–2020, representing 68% of total decade transfer expenditure, specifically in 2017 when they spent more than 3 times of their previous transfers with multiple high-cost contracts in an attempt to replace Neymar's impact after his departure but fail to match expectations. This also marks the beginning of financial instabilities and highlights inefficiencies in recruitment strategy, talent integration, and financial management.
- Since 2020, their transfer sum decreased significantly after years of excessive spending, COVID-19 revenue losses, and structural mismanagement, forcing reliance on free transfers and academy players as the results of La Liga salary cap restrictions.
- Spending patterns mirror performance cycles: overspending → inefficiency → collapse → rebuilding
- **Overall**, this analysis demonstrates that Barcelona’s current financial struggles are not isolated incidents but rather the cumulative result of poor transfer market management during their most lavish years. The reduction in transfer expenditure after 2020 was less a matter of choice than a reflection of financial necessity, marking the beginning of a new, restrictive phase shaped by La Liga’s economic controls.

### 🟢 Insights: Comparison of Squad Cost Limit between FC Barcelona and Real Madrid

![Squad Cost Limit Comparison](./outputs/figures/squad_cost_limit.png)

- The analysis of FC Barcelona's financial situation can be interpreted further by its Squad Cost Limit in La Liga compared to their rival, Real Madrid. Squad Cost Limit (LCPD) is a measure set by La Liga which define the maximum amount a club may spend on registered players, coaching staff, and youth system expenses (including salaries, amortizations, and agent fees).
- From 2019 to current season, FC Barcelona's Squad Cost Limit experienced major fluctuations that closely reflects their sporting performance trends:
  - Barcelona’s Squad Cost Limit dropped 121% from €671M (2019/20) to –€144M (2021/22), forcing the club under a restrictive “1:4” - allowing only 25% reinvestment of income rule - limiting their ability to renew contract of key players such as Messi and and sign new high-quality contracts.
  - In the 2022/23 season, the club saw a significant but temporary recovery of the limit due to the activation of the four "economic fever", including the sales of 25% of future television rights and other assets of the club such as 49% of Barça Studio. The limit rebounded to €656M, supporting key transfer and winning the La Liga title of the season.
  - However, financing the club's future can only exchange for short-term liquidity as from 2023/24 til recently, the club's financial situation continues fluctuating. Although the Squad Cost Limit initially improved in 24/25, it declined slightly this current season (25/26). Unvalidated revenue from the sale of VIP seats and delayed return to the Spotify Camp Nou reduced expected income, limiting summer transfer signings.
- Real Madrid, meanwhile, remained stable above €700M after experiencing slightly declined in 20/21 due to COVID-19, highlighting divergent financial trajectories between the two rivals.
- **Overall**: Financial constraints correlate with performance: poorer seasons coincide with the lowest salary caps, restricted transfer activity, and reduced squad depth.

### Correlation Between Financial Constraints and Team Performance

![Financial Constraints and Team Performance Correlation](./outputs/figures/financial_and_winrate_correlation.png)

- Squad Cost Limit and win rate show a strong positive correlation (r = 0.71), showing financial flexibility improves competitive performance.
- While transfer spending & win rate shows weaker correlation (r = 0.04), reinforcing that the problem wasn’t money spent, but **money spent inefficiently**.
- Financial and performance variables align strongly after 2020, indicating the club’s competitive decline was deeply tied with financial, not only tactical.

## Conclusion

FC Barcelona’s decline cannot be explained by performance metrics alone. Instead, the combined analysis shows:

- Squad mismanagement (2017–2020) created structural weaknesses
- Financial collapse (2020–2022) restricted squad-building capacity
- Efficiency declines (finishing and defensive) negatively final outcomes
- UCL performance drop mirrors domestic instability
- Financial flexibility strongly reflects competitive performance
- Overall, the **correlation between financial constraints and team performance** is evident: Financial restrictions have reduced squad's depth as the club is unable to sign high-quality players, increasing dependence on current key players, who shouldn’t be expected to perform in every match.
- **Key Takeaways**:

`Business lesson: This analysis demonstrates that operational and financial efficiency are as crucial as talent. Long-term success depends on strategic resource allocation, performance monitoring, and financial discipline - lessons relevant across industries.`

## Recommendations

- Improving Finishing Efficiency Across All Situations:
  - Target combined GF/xG > 1.10 (current ≈ 0.81) through
  - Implement finishing-focused training and tactical adjustments: expected improvement +0.15 increase in open-play GF/xG.
- Enhance Denfensive Ability:
  - Target GA reduction of 30–40% (from 44 → under 30).
  - Prioritize recruitment for high-quality Center Back (CB) and Defensive Midfiedlder (DM) positions, which are crucial for defensive system.
- Rebuild Financial Stability & Manage Resources + Recruitment:
  - FC Barcelona's challenges extends beyond tactics - the club **must restore its long-term financial stability** to rebuild their position as one of top-tier clubs and regain their competitiveness against other rivals.
  - Optimize recruitment efficiency for high-value player acquisitions
  - Use data-driven performance & scouting to guide tactical and operational decisions

## Limitations & Potential Improvements in The Future

**Limitations:**

- Limited dataset granularity: match-level stats and player-level contributions are not considered
- Partial of financial data are unavailable or approximate. (e.g., Squad Cost Limit from 2014-2018)

**Future Work:**

- Integrate match-level or player-level datasets for advanced metrics (e.g., minutes played, passes, pressing, possession)  
- Include amount earned from transfer departures to have better understanding about their earning & spending habit, and to determine whether this factor will emphasize their weakness in financial management.
- Comparative analysis with other top clubs over the same period.
