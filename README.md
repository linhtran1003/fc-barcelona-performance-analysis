# Project Title: Performance Analysis of FC Barcelona - A Decade of Evolution and Recurring Challenges in Competitions

## Project Overview and Motivation

- After their peak in 2014/2015, FC Barcelona has transitioned from European dominance to facing recurring challenges in both domestic and continental competitions. This project analyzes FC Barcelona's performance trends over the past decade (2014–2025) in domestic (La Liga) and international (UEFA Champions League) competitions. It explores attacking and defensive metrics, finishing efficiency, and financial factors such as transfer spending and squad cost limits to identify potential drivers behind the club’s recent decline and rebuilding phase.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Github for version control and project sharing

## Key Analysis and Findings

### Perforamance Trends

- Goals scored at the highest level between 14/15 and 16/17, and then declined gradually, reaching the lowest in 2022.
- League rank doesn't always directly correlate with goals scored, highlighting other influencing factors such as defensive performance and consistency.

### Defensive Weaknesses

- Goal difference decreased steadily after the 14/15 season.
- 21//22 marked the lowest level in FC Barcelona's performance, with low goals scored but high goals conceded.
- Managerial changes in 22/23 as Xavi Hernandez came improved the defense temporarily, but consistency remains as their problem.

### Finishing Efficiency (Expected Goals vs Goals-For)

- Open play efficiency averaged 1.02 GF/xG (slightly above expected) between 2014 and 2019, declining to 0.95 post 19/20.
- Set-piece efficiency, particularly freekick, dropped after Messi’s departure in 20/21, showing reliance on key players.
- Overall, finishing inefficiency post-2020 may have cost them points in decisive matches.

### UEFA Chaampions League Performance

- Post-14/15, Barcelona failed to progress beyond Quarter-Finals and Semi-Finals in 8 of 10 seasons.
- Performance inconsistencies in UCL and UEL correlate with defensive issues and squad depth.

### Financial Analysis

- Heavy transfer spending (2016–2020) did not result in proportional on-field improvement.
- COVID-19 and financial mismanagement reduced transfer activity post-20/21, forcing reliance on young players from their academy - La Masia - and free transfers.
- Squad cost limits fluctuated from 19/20, impacting competitiveness relative to Real Madrid.
- **Correlation**: higher financial flexibility generally improves win rate and squad depth, while restrictions lead to inconsistent performance.

## Conclusion

- Over the past decade, FC Barcelona’s journey from dominance to reconstruction reflects the deep interplay between financial constraints, tactical transition, and player turnover.
- The data reveals that declining squad efficiency and defensive inconsistency coincided with the club’s financial tightening post-2020. Despite a brief rebound in 22/23 season, sustained success remains limited by squad renewal constraints under La Liga’s financial rules.
- Ultimately, restoring long-term competitiveness will require not only tactical refinement but also sustainable financial recovering - ensuring that spending power, recruitment strategy, and player development align more effectively.
